            <p>This is a little bit about me. I am not entirely sure what to put in here but I will fill it up with content when I am closer to having a completed website. Thank you for taking the time to learn about me and please explore some of my projects below. I will need to fill this with some more background info around me to make the page feel fuller but this is a good start I think. I am excited with what I got.</p>
